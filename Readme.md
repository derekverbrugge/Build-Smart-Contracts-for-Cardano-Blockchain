The Haskell Fundamentals Section of [this](https://www.udemy.com/share/107C803@x81XLb87CPEnEKTaZ2zdK9cTUofwredMyN7Hk7VRH3HkMh7xWJsWQEEdfExLYo1T/) Udemy course is included here. The Marlowe portion of the course appears to be out of date. If the course is updated, it will likely be included here in the future. In place of these examples, I've supplied current  examples from [Marlowe](https://play.marlowe-finance.io/#/) for the time being.
